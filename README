This is a Mach-O loader for linux.

* Usage

% make release
% ./ld-mac mac_binary [options...]

You need OpenCFLite (http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencflite/)
installed if you want to run some programs such as dsymutil.
opencflite-476.17.2 is recommended.

* How to use compiler tool chains of Xcode

Get xcode_3.2.6_and_ios_sdk_4.3__final.dmg (or another xcode package).

% git clone git@github.com:shinh/maloader.git
% ./maloader/unpack_xcode.sh xcode_3.2.6_and_ios_sdk_4.3__final.dmg
% sudo cp -a xcode_3.2.6_and_ios_sdk_4.3__final/root /usr/i686-apple-darwin10
% cd maloader
% make release
% ./ld-mac /usr/i686-apple-darwin10/usr/bin/gcc mach/hello.c
% ./ld-mac a.out

* How to run Mach-O binaries using binfmt_misc

% ./binfmt_misc.sh
% /usr/i686-apple-darwin10/usr/bin/gcc mach/hello.c
% ./a.out

To remove the entries, run the following commands:

% ./binfmt_misc.sh stop

* Which programs should work

OK

- gcc-4.2 (link with -g requires OpenCFLite)
- otool
- nm
- dyldinfo
- dwarfdump
- strip
- size
- dsymutil (need OpenCFLite)
- cpp-4.2
- clang
-- clang-70 (xcode 3.2.6): OK, but linking wasn't checked due to lack of sysroot
-- clang-137 (xcode 4.0): OK

not OK

- llvm-gcc
- gnumake and bsdmake
- lex and flex
- ar
- m4
- gdb
- libtool
- nasm and ndisasm (i386)
- mpicc, mpicxx, and mpic++

* Notice

- Running all Mac binaries isn't my goal. Only command line tools such
  as compiler tool chain can be executed by this loader.
- Currently, this only supports x86-64.
