.Sh NAME
.Nm pthread_setspecific
.Nd set a thread-specific data value
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <pthread.h>
.Ft int
.Fo pthread_setspecific
.Fa "pthread_key_t key"
.Fa "const void *value"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pthread_setspecific
function associates a thread-specific value with a
.Fa key
obtained via a previous call to
.Fn pthread_key_create .
Different threads may bind different values to the same key.
These values are
typically pointers to blocks of dynamically allocated memory that have been
reserved for use by the calling thread.
.Pp
The effect of calling
.Fn pthread_setspecific
with a key value not obtained from
.Fn pthread_key_create ,
or after
.Fa key
has been deleted with
.Fn pthread_key_delete ,
is undefined.
.Pp
.Fn pthread_setspecific
may be called from a thread-specific data destructor function;
however, this may result in lost storage or infinite loops.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful,  the
.Fn pthread_setspecific
function will return zero.
Otherwise, an error number will be returned to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn pthread_setspecific
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa key
value is invalid.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Insufficient memory exists to associate the value with the
.Fa key .
