.Sh NAME
.Nm fmod
.Nd floating-point remainder function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn fmod "double x" "double y"
.Ft long double
.Fn fmodl "long double x" "long double y"
.Ft float
.Fn fmodf "float x" "float y"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn fmod
functions compute the floating-point remainder of
.Fa x Ns / Fa y .
.Pp
Specifically, the functions return the value
.Sm off
.Fa x - Em i * Fa y ,
.Sm on
for some integer
.Em i
such that, if
.Fa y
is non-zero, the result has the same sign as
.Fa x
and magnitude less than the magnitude of
.Fa y .
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn fmod "±0, y"
returns ±0 if y is neither 0 nor NaN.
.Pp
.Fn fmod "x, y"
returns a NaN and raises the "invalid" floating-point exception for x infinite or y zero.
.Pp
.Fn fmod "x, ±infinity"
returns x for x not infinite.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr math 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn fmod
functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:1999(E).
