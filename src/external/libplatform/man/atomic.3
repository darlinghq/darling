.Sh NAME
.Nm OSAtomicEnqueue ,
.Nm OSAtomicDequeue
.Nd atomic lockless queues
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libkern/OSAtomic.h
.Ft void
.Fn OSAtomicEnqueue "OSQueueHead *list" "void *new" "size_t offset"
.Ft void*
.Fn OSAtomicDequeue "OSQueueHead *list" "size_t offset"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The routines
.Fn OSAtomicEnqueue
and
.Fn OSAtomicDequeue
operate on singly linked LIFO queues.  Ie, a dequeue operation will return the
most recently enqueued element, or NULL if the list is empty.  The operations
are lockless, and barriers are used as necessary to permit thread-safe access to
the queue element.
.Fa offset
is the offset in bytes to the link field in the queue element.
.Pp
.Bf -symbolic
Important: the memory backing the link field of a queue element must not be
unmapped after
.Fn OSAtomicDequeue
returns until all concurrent calls to
.Fn OSAtomicDequeue
for the same list on other threads have also returned, as they may still be
accessing that memory location.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent
	typedef struct elem {
		long	data1;
		struct elem *link;
		int	data2;
	} elem_t;
	
	elem_t fred, mary, *p;
	
	OSQueueHead q = OS_ATOMIC_QUEUE_INIT;
	
	OSAtomicEnqueue( &q, &fred, offsetof(elem_t,link) );
	OSAtomicEnqueue( &q, &mary, offsetof(elem_t,link) );
	
	p = OSAtomicDequeue( &q, offsetof(elem_t,link) );
	
.Ed
In this example, the call of
.Fn OSAtomicDequeue
will return a ptr to mary.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The dequeue operation returns the most recently enqueued element, or NULL if the list in empty.
