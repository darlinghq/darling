.Fn sysctl "int *name" "u_int namelen" "void *oldp" "size_t *oldlenp" "void *newp" "size_t newlen"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sysctl
function retrieves system information and allows processes with
appropriate privileges to set system information.
The information available from
.Fn sysctl
consists of integers, strings, and tables.
Information may be retrieved and set from the command interface
using the
.Xr sysctl 8
utility.
.Pp
Unless explicitly noted below,
.Fn sysctl
returns a consistent snapshot of the data requested.
Consistency is obtained by locking the destination
buffer into memory so that the data may be copied out without blocking.
Calls to
.Fn sysctl
are serialized to avoid deadlock.
.Pp
The state is described using a ``Management Information Base'' (MIB)
style name, listed in
.Fa name ,
which is a
.Fa namelen
length array of integers.
.Pp
The
.Fn sysctlbyname
function accepts an ASCII representation of the name and internally
looks up the integer name vector.
Apart from that, it behaves the same
as the standard
.Fn sysctl
function.
.Pp
The information is copied into the buffer specified by
.Fa oldp .
The size of the buffer is given by the location specified by
.Fa oldlenp
before the call,
and that location gives the amount of data copied after a successful call
and after a call that returns with the error code
.Er ENOMEM .
If the amount of data available is greater
than the size of the buffer supplied,
the call supplies as much data as fits in the buffer provided
and returns with the error code
.Er ENOMEM .
If the old value is not desired,
.Fa oldp
and
.Fa oldlenp
should be set to NULL.
.Pp
The size of the available data can be determined by calling
.Fn sysctl
with the
.Dv NULL
argument for
.Fa oldp .
The size of the available data will be returned in the location pointed to by
.Fa oldlenp .
For some operations, the amount of space may change often.
For these operations,
the system attempts to round up so that the returned size is
large enough for a call to return the data shortly thereafter.
.Pp
To set a new value,
.Fa newp
is set to point to a buffer of length
.Fa newlen
from which the requested value is to be taken.
If a new value is not to be set,
.Fa newp
should be set to NULL and
.Fa newlen
set to 0.
.Pp
The
.Fn sysctlnametomib
function accepts an ASCII representation of the name,
looks up the integer name vector,
and returns the numeric representation in the mib array pointed to by
.Fa mibp .
The number of elements in the mib array is given by the location specified by
.Fa sizep
before the call,
and that location gives the number of entries copied after a successful call.
The resulting
.Fa mib
and
.Fa size
may be used in subsequent
.Fn sysctl
calls to get the data associated with the requested ASCII name.
This interface is intended for use by applications that want to
repeatedly request the same variable (the
.Fn sysctl
function runs in about a third the time as the same request made via the
.Fn sysctlbyname
function).
The
.Fn sysctlnametomib
function is also useful for fetching mib prefixes and then adding
a final component.
For example, to fetch process information
for processes with pid's less than 100:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
int i, mib[4];
size_t len;
struct kinfo_proc kp;

/* Fill out the first three components of the mib */
len = 4;
sysctlnametomib("kern.proc.pid", mib, &len);

/* Fetch and print entries for pid's < 100 */
for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
	mib[3] = i;
	len = sizeof(kp);
	if (sysctl(mib, 4, &kp, &len, NULL, 0) == -1)
		perror("sysctl");
	else if (len > 0)
		printkproc(&kp);
}
.Ed
.Pp
Note:  Implementation of
.Fn printkproc
-- to print whatever data deemed necessary from the large
.Vt kinfo_proc
structure (
.In sys/sysctl.h
) -- is left as an exercise for the reader.
.Pp
The top level names are defined with a CTL_ prefix in
.In sys/sysctl.h ,
and are as follows.
The next and subsequent levels down are found in the include files
listed here, and described in separate sections below.
.Pp
.Bl -column CTLXMACHDEP "Next level names" -offset indent
.It Sy "Name	Next level names	Description"
.It "CTL_DEBUG	sys/sysctl.h	Debugging"
.It "CTL_VFS	sys/mount.h	File system"

.It "CTL_VM	sys/resources.h	Virtual memory (struct loadavg)"
.It "CTL_VM	sys/vmmeter.h	Virtual memory (struct vmtotal)"
.El
.Pp
For example, the following retrieves the maximum number of processes allowed
in the system:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
int mib[2], maxproc;
size_t len;

mib[0] = CTL_KERN;
mib[1] = KERN_MAXPROC;
len = sizeof(maxproc);
sysctl(mib, 2, &maxproc, &len, NULL, 0);
.Ed
.Pp
To retrieve the standard search path for the system utilities:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
int mib[2];
size_t len;
char *p;

mib[0] = CTL_USER;
mib[1] = USER_CS_PATH;
sysctl(mib, 2, NULL, &len, NULL, 0);
p = malloc(len);
sysctl(mib, 2, p, &len, NULL, 0);
.Ed
.Ss CTL_DEBUG
The debugging variables vary from system to system.
A debugging variable may be added or deleted without need to recompile
.Fn sysctl
to know about it.
Each time it runs,
.Fn sysctl
gets the list of debugging variables from the kernel and
displays their current values.
The system defines twenty
.Pq Vt "struct ctldebug"
variables named
.Va debug0
through
.Va debug19 .
They are declared as separate variables so that they can be
individually initialized at the location of their associated variable.
The loader prevents multiple use of the same variable by issuing errors
if a variable is initialized in more than one place.
For example, to export the variable
.Va dospecialcheck
as a debugging variable, the following declaration would be used:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
int dospecialcheck = 1;
struct ctldebug debug5 = { "dospecialcheck", &dospecialcheck };
.Ed
.Ss CTL_VFS
A distinguished second level name, VFS_GENERIC,
is used to get general information about all file systems.
One of its third level identifiers is VFS_MAXTYPENUM
that gives the highest valid file system type number.
Its other third level identifier is VFS_CONF that
returns configuration information about the file system
type given as a fourth level identifier (see
.Xr getvfsbyname 3
as an example of its use).
The remaining second level identifiers are the
file system type number returned by a
.Xr statfs 2
call or from VFS_CONF.
The third level identifiers available for each file system
are given in the header file that defines the mount
argument structure for that file system.
.Ss CTL_HW
The string and integer information available for the CTL_HW level
is detailed below.
The changeable column shows whether a process with appropriate

.It Li VM_LOADAVG
Return the load average history.
The returned data consists of a
.Va struct loadavg .
.It Li VM_PAGEOUT_ALGORITHM
0 if the statistics-based page management algorithm is in use
or 1 if the near-LRU algorithm is in use.
.It Li VM_SWAPPING_ENABLED
1 if process swapping is enabled or 0 if disabled.
This variable is
permanently set to 0 if the kernel was built with swapping disabled.
.It Li VM_V_CACHE_MAX
Maximum desired size of the cache queue.
.It Li VM_V_CACHE_MIN
Minimum desired size of the cache queue.
If the cache queue size
falls very far below this value, the pageout daemon is awakened.
.It Li VM_V_FREE_MIN
Minimum amount of memory (cache memory plus free memory)
required to be available before a process waiting on memory will be
awakened.
.It Li VM_V_FREE_RESERVED
Processes will awaken the pageout daemon and wait for memory if the
number of free and cached pages drops below this value.
.It Li VM_V_FREE_TARGET
The total amount of free memory (including cache memory) that the
pageout daemon tries to maintain.
.It Li VM_V_INACTIVE_TARGET
The desired number of inactive pages that the pageout daemon should
achieve when it runs.
Inactive pages can be quickly inserted into
process address space when needed.
.It Li VM_V_PAGEOUT_FREE_MIN
If the amount of free and cache memory falls below this value, the
pageout daemon will enter "memory conserving mode" to avoid deadlock.

.Sh ERRORS
The following errors may be reported:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The buffer
.Fa name ,
.Fa oldp ,
.Fa newp ,
or length pointer
.Fa oldlenp
contains an invalid address.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa name
array is less than two or greater than CTL_MAXNAME.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
A non-null
.Fa newp
is given and its specified length in
.Fa newlen
is too large or too small.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
The length pointed to by
.Fa oldlenp
is too short to hold the requested value.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
The smaller of either the length pointed to by
.Fa oldlenp
or the estimated size of the returned data exceeds the
system limit on locked memory.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Locking the buffer
.Fa oldp ,
or a portion of the buffer if the estimated size of the data
to be returned is smaller,
would cause the process to exceed its per-process locked memory limit.
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
The
.Fa name
array specifies an intermediate rather than terminal name.
.It Bq Er EISDIR
The
.Fa name
array specifies a terminal name, but the actual name is not terminal.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The
.Fa name
array specifies a value that is unknown.
.It Bq Er EPERM
An attempt is made to set a read-only value.
.It Bq Er EPERM
A process without appropriate privilege attempts to set a value.
