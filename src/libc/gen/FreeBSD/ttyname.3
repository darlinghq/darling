.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions operate on the system file descriptors for terminal
type devices.
These descriptors are not related to the standard
.Tn I/O
.Dv FILE
typedef, but refer to the special device files found in
.Pa /dev
and named
.Pa /dev/tty Ns Ar xx
and for which an entry exists
in the initialization file
.Pa /etc/ttys .
(See
.Xr ttys 5 . )
.Pp
The
.Fn isatty
function
determines if the file descriptor
.Fa fildes
refers to a valid
terminal type device.
.Pp
The
.Fn ttyname
function
gets the related device name of
a file descriptor for which
.Fn isatty
is true.
.Pp
The
.Fn ttyslot
function
fetches the current process' control terminal number from the
.Xr ttys 5
file entry.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn ttyname
function
returns the null terminated name if the device is found and
.Fn isatty
is true; otherwise, a
.Dv NULL
pointer is returned.
.Pp
The
.Fn ttyslot
function returns the unit number of the device file if found;
otherwise, the value zero is returned.
.Sh FILES

.Sh HISTORY
A
.Fn isatty ,
.Fn ttyname ,
and
.Fn ttyslot
function
appeared in
.At v7 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fn ttyname
function leaves its result in an internal static object and returns
a pointer to that object.
Subsequent calls to
.Fn ttyname
will modify the same object.
