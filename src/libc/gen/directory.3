.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn opendir
function
opens the directory named by
.Fa dirname ,
associates a
.Em directory stream
with it,
and returns a pointer to be used to identify the
.Em directory stream
in subsequent operations.  The pointer
.Dv NULL
is returned if
.Fa dirname
cannot be accessed or if it cannot
.Xr malloc 3
enough memory to hold the whole thing.
.Pp
The
.Fn readdir
function
returns a pointer to the next directory entry.  It returns
.Dv NULL
upon reaching the end of the directory or detecting an invalid
.Fn seekdir
operation.
.Pp
.Fn readdir_r
provides the same functionality as
.Fn readdir ,
but the caller must provide a directory
.Fa entry
buffer to store the results in.  If the read succeeds,
.Fa result
is pointed at the
.Fa entry ;
upon reaching the end of the directory,
.Fa result
is set to
.Dv NULL .
.Fn readdir_r
returns 0 on success or an error number to indicate failure.
.Pp
The
.Fn telldir
function
returns the current location associated with the named
.Em directory stream .
Values returned by
.Fn telldir
are good only for the lifetime of the
.Dv DIR
pointer (e.g.,
.Fa dirp )
from which they are derived.  If the directory is closed and then
reopened, prior values returned by
.Fn telldir
will no longer be valid.
.Pp
The
.Fn seekdir
function
sets the position of the next
.Fn readdir
operation on the
.Em directory stream .
The new position reverts to the one associated with the
.Em directory stream
when the
.Fn telldir
operation was performed.
.Pp
The
.Fn rewinddir
function
resets the position of the named
.Em directory stream
to the beginning of the directory.
.Pp
The
.Fn closedir
function
closes the named
.Em directory stream
and frees the structure associated with the
.Fa dirp
pointer,
returning 0 on success.
On failure, \-1 is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Pp
The
.Fn dirfd
function
returns the integer file descriptor associated with the named
.Em directory stream 
on success, see
.Xr open 2 .
On failure, \-1 is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Pp
Sample code which searches a directory for entry ``name'' is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
len = strlen(name);
dirp = opendir(".");
while ((dp = readdir(dirp)) != NULL)
	if (dp->d_namlen == len && !strcmp(dp->d_name, name)) {
		(void)closedir(dirp);
		return FOUND;
	}
(void)closedir(dirp);
return NOT_FOUND;
