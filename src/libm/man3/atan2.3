.Sh NAME
.Nm atan2
.Nd arc tangent function of two variables
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn atan2 "double y" "double x"
.Ft long double
.Fn atan2l "long double y" "long double x"
.Ft float
.Fn atan2f "float y" "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn atan2
function computes the principal value of the arc tangent of
.Ar y/ Ns Ar x ,
using the signs of both arguments to determine the quadrant of
the return value.
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn atan2 "±0, -0"
returns ±pi.
.Pp
.Fn atan2 "±0, +0"
returns ±0.
.Pp
.Fn atan2 "±0, x"
returns ±pi for x < 0.
.Pp
.Fn atan2 "±0, x"
returns ±0 for x > 0.
.Pp
.Fn atan2 "y, ±0"
returns +pi/2 for y > 0.
.Pp
.Fn atan2 "y, ±0"
returns -pi/2 for y < 0.
.Pp
.Fn atan2 "±y, -infinity"
returns ±pi for finite y > 0.
.Pp
.Fn atan2 "±y, +infinity"
returns ±0 for finite y > 0.
.Pp
.Fn atan2 "±infinity, x"
returns ±pi/2 for finite x.
.Pp
.Fn atan2 "±infinity, -infinity"
returns ±3*pi/4.
.Pp
.Fn atan2 "±infinity, +infinity"
returns ±pi/4.
.Sh NOTES
The
.Fn atan2
function is used mostly to convert from rectangular (x,y)
to polar
.if n\
(r,theta)
.if t\
(r,\(*h)
coordinates that must satisfy x =
.if n\
r\(**cos theta
.if t\
r\(**cos\(*h
and y =
.if n\
r\(**sin theta.
.if t\
r\(**sin\(*h.
In general, conversions to polar coordinates
should be computed thus:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
.if n \{\
r	:= hypot(x,y);  ... := sqrt(x\(**x+y\(**y)
theta	:= atan2(y,x).
.\}
.if t \{\
r	:= hypot(x,y);  ... := \(sr(x\u\s82\s10\d+y\u\s82\s10\d)
\(*h	:= atan2(y,x).
.\}
