.Sh NAME
.Nm remainder
.Nd floating-point remainder function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn remainder "double x" "double y"
.Ft long double
.Fn remainderl "long double x" "long double y"
.Ft float
.Fn remainderf "float x" "float y"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn remainder
functions compute the value r such that r = x - n*y, where n is the integer nearest the exact value of x/y.
.Pp
If there are two integers closest to x/y, n shall be the even one. If r is zero, it is given the same sign as x.
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn remainder "x, y"
returns a NaN and raises the "invalid" floating-point exception if x is infinite or y is 0.
.Sh NOTE
The
.Fn drem
function is deprecated.  Please use the C99 function
.Fn remainder
instead.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr math 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn remainder
functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:1999(E).
