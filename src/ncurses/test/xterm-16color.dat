# This illustrates the predefined colors for XFree86 xterm's "xterm-16color". 
# If you set $TERM to "xterm-88color" (and have xterm compiled to support the
# 88-color or 256-color feature), you can use the ncurses 'd' screen to
# manipulate the colors shown in the screen.  The 'd' screen is limited to
# the first 16 colors, and xterm happens to use the same first 16 colors in
# the extended color models that support initc.
#
# The colors shown are for xterm patch #189.
